						<strong> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </strong>
						was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the
						<strong>11th President of India from 2002 to 2007</strong>. He was
						born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and
						aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist
						and science administrator, mainly at the
						<span class="b l u">
							Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)
						</span>
						and
						<span class="b l u">Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</span>
						and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and
						military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as
						the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of
						ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. Kalam was elected
						as the <span class="b">11th President of India in 2002</span> with
						the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
						then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
						" <span class="b">People's President</span> ", he returned to his
						civilian life of education, writing and public service after a
						single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards,
						including the <span class="b l">Bharat Ratna</span> , India's
						highest civilian honour.
					</p>
					<p>
						He was born on <span class="b">15 October 1931</span> to a Tamil
						Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban
						Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil
						Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of
						a local mosque, his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father
						owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between
						Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the
						youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.
